# Dashboard API Integration & RBAC Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive API integration and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) implementation for all dashboard components in the KandyPack Logistics Platform frontend.

## Components Updated

### 1. **AdminOverview.tsx** ✅
**Purpose**: System-wide overview widget showing staff, operational metrics, and system health

**API Integrations**:
- `UsersAPI.getAll()` - Fetch all system users
- `DriversAPI.getAll()` - Fetch driver data with status
- `AssistantsAPI.getAll()` - Fetch assistant data
- `StoresAPI.getAll()` - Fetch all stores/warehouses
- `TrucksAPI.getAll()` - Fetch truck availability status
- `RoutesAPI.getAll()` - Fetch active routes

**RBAC Implementation**:
- All users can view (read-only widget)
- SystemAdmin & Management see all data (scope: 'all')
- Warehouse-scoped roles see filtered data by warehouse_id

**Features**:
- Real-time system health stats (Total Users, Active, Inactive)
- Staff breakdown by role (Drivers, Assistants, Store Managers, Warehouse Staff, Management)
- Operational readiness metrics (Stores, Available Trucks, Active Routes)
- Recent staff activity list
- Loading states and error handling

---

### 2. **WeeklyOrderChart.tsx** ✅
**Purpose**: Visualize order trends over time with revenue/order volume tracking

**API Integrations**:
- `OrdersAPI.getAll(filters)` - Fetch orders with date range and status filters

**RBAC Implementation**:
```typescript
const canViewOrders = user && (
  hasPermission(user.role as UserRole, 'order', 'read') ||
  hasPermission(user.role as UserRole, '*', 'read')
);
```

**Permission-Based Filtering**:
- **SystemAdmin & Management**: View all orders (scope: 'all')
- **StoreManager & WarehouseStaff**: View warehouse-scoped orders only
- **Driver**: View own deliveries only (scope: 'own')
- **Customer**: View own orders only (scope: 'own')

**Features**:
- Time period selection (This Week, Last Week, Last Month, Last 3 Months)
- Metric toggle (Orders vs Revenue)
- Dynamic date range filtering
- Warehouse-scoped data for warehouse roles
- Data aggregation by day/week/month
- Fallback to demo data on API errors
- Permission denied state with visual indicator

**Filters Applied**:
```typescript
const filters: any = {
  start_date: startDate.toISOString().split('T')[0],
  end_date: endDate.toISOString().split('T')[0]
};

// Warehouse-scoped roles get filtered data
if (user?.warehouseId && user.role !== UserRole.SYSTEM_ADMIN && user.role !== UserRole.MANAGEMENT) {
  filters.warehouse_id = user.warehouseId;
}
```

---

### 3. **DeliveryProgress.tsx** ✅
**Purpose**: Track delivery status distribution with completion percentage

**API Integrations**:
- `OrdersAPI.getAll(filters)` - Fetch orders for status analysis

**RBAC Implementation**:
```typescript
const canViewOrders = user && (
  hasPermission(user.role as UserRole, 'order', 'read') ||
  hasPermission(user.role as UserRole, '*', 'read')
);

const canDownloadStats = user && (
  hasPermission(user.role as UserRole, 'reports', 'execute') ||
  hasPermission(user.role as UserRole, '*', 'execute')
);
```

**Permission-Based Features**:
- **View Orders**: Required to see delivery stats
  - Granted to: SystemAdmin, Management, StoreManager, WarehouseStaff, Driver (own)
- **Download Reports**: Required to export CSV
  - Granted to: SystemAdmin, Management only

**Status Mapping**:
```typescript
// Backend status → Frontend display
DELIVERED/COMPLETED → Delivered
IN_TRANSIT/SHIPPED/OUT_FOR_DELIVERY → In Transit
PLACED/PENDING/CONFIRMED → Pending
```

**Features**:
- Circular progress indicator showing delivery completion %
- Three-tier status breakdown (Delivered, In Transit, Pending)
- Count and percentage display for each status
- Total orders summary
- CSV export functionality (permission-gated)
- Warehouse-scoped filtering for warehouse roles
- Loading and error states
- Permission denied visual indicator

### 4. **LogisticsMap.tsx** ✅
**Purpose**: Real-time geographic visualization of stores and trucks

**API Integrations**:
- `StoresAPI.getAll(filters)` - Fetch store locations
- `TrucksAPI.getAll(filters)` - Fetch truck positions

**RBAC Implementation**:
```typescript
const canViewStores = user && (
  hasPermission(user.role as UserRole, 'store', 'read') ||
  hasPermission(user.role as UserRole, 'warehouse', 'read') ||
  hasPermission(user.role as UserRole, '*', 'read')
);

const canViewTrucks = user && (
  hasPermission(user.role as UserRole, 'truck', 'read') ||
  hasPermission(user.role as UserRole, '*', 'read')
);
```

**Permission Matrix**:
| Role | View Stores | View Trucks | Scope |
|------|------------|-------------|-------|
| SystemAdmin | ✅ | ✅ | All |
| Management | ✅ | ✅ | All |
| StoreManager | ✅ | ✅ | Warehouse |
| WarehouseStaff | ✅ | ✅ | Warehouse |
| Driver | ❌ | ✅ | Own truck |
| DriverAssistant | ✅ | ✅ | Warehouse |
| Customer | ❌ | ❌ | None |

**Features**:
- Interactive Leaflet map with OpenStreetMap tiles
- Blue markers for store locations
- Red markers for truck positions
- Popup details on marker click
- Warehouse-scoped filtering
- Dynamic marker counts in legend
- Coordinate parsing from multiple field formats
- GPS-based truck positioning (with fallback)
- Limited access indicator badge
- Loading and error states

**Coordinate Handling**:
```typescript
// Supports multiple coordinate field formats
if (store.latitude && store.longitude) { ... }
else if (store.lat && store.lng) { ... }
else if (store.coordinates) { 
  // Parse "lat,lng" string format
}
```

## RBAC System Overview

### User Roles (from roles.ts)
1. **Customer** - Own data only (scope: 'own')
2. **Management** - Full read access, user management (scope: 'all')
3. **StoreManager** - Warehouse operations (scope: 'warehouse')
4. **WarehouseStaff** - Inventory operations (scope: 'warehouse')
5. **Driver** - Own deliveries only (scope: 'own')
6. **DriverAssistant** - Scheduling, warehouse trucks (scope: 'warehouse')
7. **SystemAdmin** - Full access to everything (scope: 'all')

### Permission Helper Functions

#### hasPermission(role, resource, action)
Checks if a role has permission to perform an action on a resource.

```typescript
// Example usage
if (hasPermission(user.role, 'order', 'read')) {
  // User can view orders
}
```

#### hasPermissionWithScope(role, resource, action, userWarehouseId, resourceWarehouseId)
Validates permission with warehouse scope consideration.

```typescript
// Example usage
if (hasPermissionWithScope(user.role, 'order', 'update', user.warehouseId, order.warehouseId)) {
  // User can update this specific order
}
```

### Scope-Based Filtering

**All Scope** (SystemAdmin, Management):
```typescript
// No filters applied - see everything
const data = await API.getAll();
```

**Warehouse Scope** (StoreManager, WarehouseStaff, DriverAssistant):
```typescript
// Filter by user's assigned warehouse
const filters = { warehouse_id: user.warehouseId };
const data = await API.getAll(filters);
```

**Own Scope** (Customer, Driver):
```typescript
// Filter by user's own resources
const filters = { user_id: user.id };
const data = await API.getAll(filters);
```

## API Service Architecture

### HttpClient (api.ts)
Centralized HTTP client with:
- JWT token management
- Automatic Bearer header injection
- Error handling and ApiError class
- JSON/text response parsing

### Token Service
```typescript
TokenService.getToken()      // Get JWT from localStorage
TokenService.setToken(token)  // Store JWT
TokenService.getUser()        // Get user object
TokenService.setUser(user)    // Store user object
TokenService.clear()          // Clear all auth data
```

### API Modules Available
- `AuthAPI` - Login, register, token refresh
- `UsersAPI` - User CRUD operations
- `OrdersAPI` - Order management with filtering
- `CustomersAPI` - Customer data
- `StoresAPI` - Store/warehouse locations

) : (
  // Content
)}
```

2. **Error States**
```typescript
{error && (
  <AlertCircle />
  <p>{error}</p>
)}
```

3. **Permission Denied States**
```typescript
{!canView && (
  <div className="bg-status-cancelled">
    No Permission
  </div>
)}
```

4. **Empty States**
```typescript
{data.length === 0 && (
  <p>No data available</p>
)}
```

5. **Warehouse Assignment Warnings**
```typescript
{!user.warehouseId && (
  <div className="bg-yellow-50">
    You are not assigned to a warehouse
  </div>
)}
```

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Client-Side Permission Checks
- Always verify permissions before showing UI elements
- Hide sensitive actions from unauthorized users
- Display permission denied messages clearly

### 2. API Request Filtering
- Apply role-based filters to API requests
- Never rely solely on client-side security
- Backend must validate all permissions

### 3. Token Management
- Store JWT in localStorage
- Auto-inject Bearer token in all API calls
- Clear tokens on logout

### 4. Scope Validation
- Check warehouse_id for scoped roles
- Prevent cross-warehouse data access
- Validate user.warehouseId exists for warehouse-scoped operations
