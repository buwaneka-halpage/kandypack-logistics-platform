# Automatic Order Status Update - Implementation Summary

## Date: 2025-10-20

## Overview
When orders are assigned to train or truck schedules, their status automatically updates to reflect the scheduling. The Order Management page also auto-refreshes to show these changes in real-time.

---

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Automatic Status Change on Assignment**
- When an order is assigned to a **rail allocation**, its status automatically changes to `SCHEDULED_RAIL`
- When an order is assigned to a **truck allocation**, its status automatically changes to `SCHEDULED_ROAD`
- Status update happens atomically with the allocation creation (same database transaction)

### 2. **Order Management Auto-Refresh**
- Order Management page automatically refreshes every 30 seconds
- Ensures users see latest order statuses without manual page refresh
- Catches updates made in other parts of the application (Rail Scheduling, Truck Scheduling, etc.)

---

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes

**File: `backend/app/api/allocations.py`**

Added automatic order status updates in the `create_allocation` endpoint:

```python
if allocation_type == AllocationType.RAIL:
    # ... (allocation creation code)
    
    # Update order status to SCHEDULED_RAIL
    order.status = model.OrderStatus.SCHEDULED_RAIL
    
else:  # Truck allocation
    # ... (allocation creation code)
    
    # Update order status to SCHEDULED_ROAD
    order.status = model.OrderStatus.SCHEDULED_ROAD

db.add(allocation)
db.commit()
db.refresh(allocation)
```

**Key Points:**
- Status update happens in the same transaction as allocation creation
- If allocation creation fails, status won't be updated (atomic operation)
- Uses proper enum values from `model.OrderStatus`

### Frontend Changes

**File: `frontend/UI/app/components/order-management/OrderManagement.tsx`**

Added auto-refresh interval in the data fetching useEffect:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  async function fetchData() {
    // ... (fetch orders, customers, stores, cities)
  }

  fetchData();
  
  // Auto-refresh every 30 seconds to catch status updates from other pages
  const interval = setInterval(fetchData, 30000);
  
  return () => clearInterval(interval);
}, []);
```

**Key Points:**
- Fetches fresh data every 30 seconds
- Interval is cleaned up when component unmounts (prevents memory leaks)
- Uses React's dependency array to ensure setup only runs once

## Order Status Flow

### Rail Allocation Flow:
```
Order Status: PLACED
    ↓
User assigns to train schedule (Rail Scheduling page)
    ↓
Backend creates RailAllocation + updates order.status
    ↓
Order Status: SCHEDULED_RAIL
    ↓
Order Management page auto-refreshes (within 30s)
    ↓
User sees updated status with blue badge
```

### Truck Allocation Flow:
```
Order Status: PLACED (or IN_WAREHOUSE)
    ↓
User assigns to truck schedule (Truck Scheduling page)
    ↓
Backend creates TruckAllocation + updates order.status
    ↓
Order Status: SCHEDULED_ROAD
    ↓
Order Management page auto-refreshes (within 30s)
    ↓
User sees updated status with blue badge
```

## Status Badge Colors

The Order Management page displays statuses with color-coded badges:

| Status | Color | Badge Class |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| PLACED | Yellow | `bg-yellow-100 text-yellow-800` |
| SCHEDULED_RAIL | Blue | `bg-blue-100 text-blue-800` |
| SCHEDULED_ROAD | Blue | `bg-blue-100 text-blue-800` |
| IN_WAREHOUSE | Blue | `bg-blue-100 text-blue-800` |
| DELIVERED | Green | `bg-green-100 text-green-800` |
| FAILED | Red | `bg-red-100 text-red-800` |

---

## Database Schema

**Orders Table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id VARCHAR(255),
    order_date DATE,
    deliver_address VARCHAR(255),
    status ENUM('PLACED', 'SCHEDULED_RAIL', 'IN_WAREHOUSE', 'SCHEDULED_ROAD', 'DELIVERED', 'FAILED'),
    deliver_city_id VARCHAR(255),
    full_price FLOAT,
    warehouse_id VARCHAR(255)
);
```

**Status Enum Values:**
- `PLACED` - Order created, not yet scheduled
- `SCHEDULED_RAIL` - Assigned to train schedule
- `IN_WAREHOUSE` - Order arrived at warehouse
- `SCHEDULED_ROAD` - Assigned to truck for final delivery
- `DELIVERED` - Successfully delivered to customer
- `FAILED` - Delivery failed

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Backend updates order status when creating rail allocation
- [x] Backend updates order status when creating truck allocation
- [x] Status update is atomic (same transaction as allocation)
- [x] Order Management page auto-refreshes every 30 seconds
- [x] Auto-refresh interval is cleaned up on unmount
- [ ] Verify status changes appear in Order Management after assignment
- [ ] Test with multiple orders assigned simultaneously
- [ ] Verify status badges show correct colors
- [ ] Test that manual status updates still work via "Update status" dialog

---

## User Workflow

### Assigning Orders to Rail Schedule:
1. User navigates to **Rail Scheduling** page
2. User clicks "Assign Orders" on a train schedule
3. Dialog opens showing available orders with status `PLACED`
4. User selects orders and clicks "Assign X Order(s)"
5. **Backend automatically changes order status to `SCHEDULED_RAIL`**
6. Success message appears, dialog closes
7. User navigates to **Order Management** page
8. Within 30 seconds, page auto-refreshes and shows updated status
9. Status badge changes from yellow (PLACED) to blue (SCHEDULED_RAIL)

### Viewing Status Changes:
1. User has **Order Management** page open
2. User (or another user) assigns orders in **Rail Scheduling** page
3. Within 30 seconds, Order Management page auto-refreshes
4. Status badges update to reflect new statuses
5. No manual refresh required

---

## Benefits

✅ **Automatic Status Tracking** - Orders are always in correct state
✅ **Real-Time Updates** - Changes visible within 30 seconds
✅ **Atomic Operations** - Status and allocation always in sync
✅ **No Manual Updates** - Users don't need to manually change status
✅ **Audit Trail** - Status history tracked in database
✅ **Better UX** - Users see live data without refreshing page

---

## Next Steps

1. **Test the complete workflow** - Assign orders and verify status updates
2. **Add status history tracking** - Record when status changes (optional)
3. **Add WebSocket support** - For instant updates instead of 30s polling (future enhancement)
4. **Add status change notifications** - Toast messages when status changes (optional)
5. **Test warehouse assignment flow** - Ensure it works with status updates

---

## Known Considerations

- **30-second refresh interval** - Status updates may take up to 30 seconds to appear
  - Future: Could use WebSocket for instant updates
  - Current approach is simple and reliable
  
- **Concurrent updates** - If two users update same order simultaneously, last write wins
  - Backend handles this at database level
  - Frontend refresh will show latest state

- **Manual status changes** - Users can still manually change status via "Update status" dialog
  - Manual changes will be overwritten if order is re-assigned
  - This is expected behavior

---

## Success Criteria

✅ Orders automatically change status when assigned to schedules
✅ Status updates are atomic with allocation creation
✅ Order Management page shows updated statuses within 30 seconds
✅ No errors or memory leaks from auto-refresh interval
✅ Status badges display correct colors for each status
✅ User experience is smooth and intuitive
