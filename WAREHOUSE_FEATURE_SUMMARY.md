# Warehouse/Store Assignment Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Added comprehensive warehouse/store management functionality to the Order Management system, including display, assignment, and editing capabilities.

## Database Schema Verification

### ✅ No Naming Conflicts Found
- **Database Table**: `stores` (stores.store_id)
- **Orders Foreign Key**: `warehouse_id` references `stores.store_id`
- **Backend Model**: `Orders.warehouse` relationship to `Stores`
- **Frontend**: Uses both "warehouse" and "store" terminology interchangeably
- **Conclusion**: The dual naming is intentional - "warehouse" and "store" refer to the same entity

### Schema Details
```python
# Orders model
class Orders(Base):
    warehouse_id = Column(String(36), ForeignKey("stores.store_id"), nullable=True)
    warehouse = relationship("Stores")

# Stores model  
class Stores(Base):
    __tablename__ = "stores"
    store_id = Column(String(36), primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String(100), nullable=False)
    address = Column(String(255), nullable=False)
    telephone_number = Column(String(15), nullable=False)
    contact_person = Column(String(100), nullable=False)
    station_id = Column(String(36), ForeignKey("railway_stations.station_id"))
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced TypeScript Interfaces
**File**: `frontend/UI/app/components/order-management/OrderManagement.tsx`

Added new interfaces:
```typescript
interface Store {
  store_id: string;
  name: string;
  address: string;
  telephone_number: string;
  contact_person: string;
  station_id: string;
}

interface City {
  city_id: string;
  city_name: string;
  province: string;
}
```

### 2. Added Warehouse Column to Orders Table

**Before**: Table had 7 columns (Order ID, Customer, Order Date, Delivery Address, Price, Status, Actions)

**After**: Table now has 8 columns, including:
- **Warehouse/Store** column between Delivery Address and Price
- Displays store name from `stores` table
- Shows "Not assigned" in gray italic text if no warehouse assigned
- Dynamically looks up store name using `order.warehouse_id`

```tsx
<TableCell>
  {warehouseName ? (
    <span className="text-sm">{warehouseName}</span>
  ) : (
    <span className="text-sm text-gray-400 italic">Not assigned</span>
  )}
</TableCell>
```

### 3. Enhanced Edit Order Dialog

**Previously**: Only allowed editing:
- Delivery Address
- Delivery City (hardcoded options)
- Price

**Now Includes**:
- **Delivery Address** - Text input
- **Delivery City** - Dropdown populated from Cities API (real data)
- **Order Date** - Date picker (HTML5 date input)
- **Price** - Number input

```tsx
const [editForm, setEditForm] = useState({
  deliver_address: '',
  deliver_city_id: '',
  full_price: 0,
  order_date: '', // NEW
});
```

### 4. New "Assign Warehouse" Dialog

**Location**: Accessible from the 3-dot dropdown menu on each order

**Features**:
- Dropdown showing all available warehouses/stores
- Displays format: `{store.name} - {store.address}`
- "None (Clear assignment)" option to remove warehouse
- Shows selected warehouse name below dropdown
- Real-time feedback during assignment
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

**Menu Structure**:
```tsx
<DropdownMenuItem onClick={() => handleViewDetails(order)}>
  View details
</DropdownMenuItem>
<DropdownMenuItem onClick={() => handleEditOrder(order)}>
  Edit order
</DropdownMenuItem>
<DropdownMenuItem onClick={() => handleUpdateStatus(order)}>
  Update status
</DropdownMenuItem>
<DropdownMenuItem onClick={() => handleAssignWarehouse(order)}>
  Assign warehouse  ← NEW
</DropdownMenuItem>
<DropdownMenuItem onClick={() => handleDeleteOrder(order)}>
  Delete order
</DropdownMenuItem>
```

### 5. Enhanced View Details Dialog

**Added Fields**:
- **Warehouse/Store**: Displays assigned warehouse name or "Not assigned"
- **Delivery City**: Now shows city name (looked up from cities array) instead of just ID
- **Customer ID**: Added as a secondary detail in monospace font

**Improved Layout**:
- Better organized grid layout
- Shows warehouse information prominently
- Resolves IDs to human-readable names

### 6. State Management Updates

**New State Variables**:
```typescript
const [stores, setStores] = useState<Store[]>([]);
const [cities, setCities] = useState<City[]>([]);
const [isAssignWarehouseDialogOpen, setIsAssignWarehouseDialogOpen] = useState(false);
const [selectedWarehouseId, setSelectedWarehouseId] = useState<string>('');
```

**Enhanced Data Fetching**:
```typescript
// Now fetches orders, customers, stores, and cities in parallel
const [ordersData, customersData, storesData, citiesData] = await Promise.all([
  OrdersAPI.getAll(),
  CustomersAPI.getAll(),
  StoresAPI.getAll(),
  CitiesAPI.getAll()
]);
```

### 7. New Handler Functions

#### `handleAssignWarehouse()`
Opens the assign warehouse dialog with current warehouse pre-selected

#### `confirmAssignWarehouse()`
Sends update request with new warehouse_id:
```typescript
const updatePayload = {
  order_id: selectedOrder.order_id,
  customer_id: selectedOrder.customer_id,
  order_date: selectedOrder.order_date.split('T')[0],
  deliver_address: selectedOrder.deliver_address,
  status: statusEnumValue,
  deliver_city_id: selectedOrder.deliver_city_id || '',
  full_price: selectedOrder.full_price,
  warehouse_id: selectedWarehouseId || null // UPDATE HERE
};
```

## API Integration

### Endpoints Used
- `GET /stores` - Fetch all warehouses/stores
- `GET /cities` - Fetch all cities for dropdown
- `PUT /orders/{order_id}` - Update order with warehouse assignment

### Backend API Details
**File**: `backend/app/api/stores.py`
- ✅ GET endpoint exists and is functional
- ✅ Requires `WarehouseStaff` or `Management` role
- ✅ Returns all stores with full details

## What Can Be Done Now

### From the UI:
1. **View Warehouse Assignment**
   - See which warehouse is assigned to each order in the main table
   - View warehouse details in the "View Details" dialog

2. **Assign Warehouse**
   - Click 3-dot menu → "Assign warehouse"
   - Select from dropdown of all available warehouses
   - Shows warehouse name and address for easy identification
   - Can assign or clear warehouse assignment

3. **Edit Orders**
   - Change delivery address
   - Select delivery city from real city data
   - Modify order date (with 7-day future validation)
   - Update price
   - All changes validated by backend

4. **View Complete Order Details**
   - Customer name
   - Order and delivery dates
   - Full address with city name
   - Assigned warehouse/store
   - Status with color coding
   - Price

## Technical Notes

### Warehouse vs Store Terminology
- **Database**: Uses "stores" table name
- **Backend Models**: Uses both `warehouse_id` field and `warehouse` relationship
- **Frontend**: Uses "Warehouse/Store" in UI for clarity
- **No Conflicts**: Terms are used interchangeably and refer to the same entity

### Data Validation
- Backend validates warehouse_id exists in stores table (FK constraint)
- Order date validation: Only validates if date is actually being changed
- Status enum conversion: Frontend keys → Backend values
- All required fields included in update payloads

### Error Handling
- Pydantic validation errors displayed in user-friendly format
- Network errors caught and shown to user
- Loading states prevent duplicate submissions
- Dialogs can be cancelled at any time
