## Access URLs

### For Admins
- **Login Page**: `http://localhost:5173/admin`
- **After Login**: Redirects to `/dashboard`

### For Customers
- **Login Page**: To be created (e.g., `/customer/login` or `/login`)
- **After Login**: Redirects to `/customer/home`

---

## Behavior Changes

### Admin Login Flow
1. User visits `/admin` (admin login page)
2. Enters credentials
3. On success → Redirects to `/dashboard`
4. On logout → Redirects back to `/admin`

### Protected Routes
- If user tries to access any protected route without authentication
- System redirects to `/admin` (admin login page)

---

## Next Steps (Recommended)

### 1. Create Customer Login
You may want to create a separate login page for customers:
```typescript
// In routes.ts
route("/login", "routes/customer-login.tsx"),
// or
route("/customer/login", "routes/customer-login.tsx"),
```

### 2. Role-Based Routing
Consider implementing role-based redirects:
- **Admin users** → `/admin` → `/dashboard`
- **Customer users** → `/login` → `/customer/home`

### 3. Update Documentation
Update any documentation that references the old `/login` route:
- README files
- API documentation
- User guides

---

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Visit `/admin` - should show admin login page
- [ ] Login as admin - should redirect to `/dashboard`
- [ ] Logout - should redirect back to `/admin`
- [ ] Try to access `/dashboard` without login - should redirect to `/admin`
- [ ] Try to access `/orders` without login - should redirect to `/admin`
- [ ] Old `/login` route - should show 404 (route no longer exists)

---

## Notes

- The `/admin` route is now specifically for **admin-level authentication**
- Customer authentication should use a different route (to be implemented)
- All protected admin routes redirect to `/admin` when not authenticated
- The login page component (`login.tsx`) remains the same, only the route path changed

*Route change completed successfully! The admin login is now at `/admin`.* ✅
