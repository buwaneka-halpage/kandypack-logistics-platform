# Store Manager Warehouse Assignment Feature

**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Feature:** Store Manager Assignment to Warehouses with Order Filtering  
**Status:** ✅ Complete - Ready for Testing

---

## Overview

Implemented a complete warehouse assignment system where Store Managers can be assigned to specific warehouses, and their order view is automatically filtered to show only orders from their assigned warehouse(s).

---

## Business Requirement

**From User:**
> "Warehouse managers (store managers) can only see orders assigned to the warehouse that they have been assigned. The stores table can have the user ID of the store manager, then the store manager is assigned to that store. Backend needs logic to check if a store manager is assigned to any such stores, then show relevant orders."

---

## Database Schema

### Stores Table (`contact_person` field):

```sql
CREATE TABLE stores (
    store_id VARCHAR(36) PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    telephone_number VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,
    address VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    contact_person VARCHAR(36),  -- FK to users.user_id (Store Manager)
    station_id VARCHAR(36) NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (contact_person) REFERENCES users(user_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (station_id) REFERENCES railway_stations(station_id)
);
```

**Key Field:**
- `contact_person`: Stores the `user_id` of the assigned Store Manager
- When a Store Manager is assigned, their `user_id` is stored in this field
- This links the warehouse to a specific Store Manager

---

## Implementation Summary

### Backend Changes:

1. **✅ Orders API (`Backend/app/api/orders.py`)**
   - Modified `GET /orders/` endpoint
   - Added role-based filtering logic
   - Store Managers see only orders from their assigned warehouses

2. **✅ Stores API (`Backend/app/api/stores.py`)**
   - Modified `GET /stores/` endpoint
   - Added `manager_name` field to response
   - Looks up manager name from `users` table

3. **✅ Users API (`Backend/app/api/users.py`)**
   - Added new endpoint: `GET /users/store-managers/list`
   - Returns all users with `StoreManager` role
   - Used for warehouse assignment dropdown

### Frontend Changes:

1. **✅ API Service (`frontend/UI/app/services/api.ts`)**
   - Added `getStoreManagers()` method to `UsersAPI`

2. **✅ Store Management Component (`frontend/UI/app/components/stores/StoreManagement.tsx`)**
   - Changed "Contact Person" column to "Store Manager"
   - Displays manager name with badge
   - Shows "Not assigned" for unassigned warehouses
   - Modified form dialog to use dropdown for manager selection
   - Fetches list of Store Managers for dropdown

---

## Backend Logic - Order Filtering

### File: `Backend/app/api/orders.py` (Lines 63-104)

```python
@router.get("/", response_model=List[schemas.order], status_code=status.HTTP_200_OK)
def get_all_Orders(db: db_dependency, current_user: dict = Depends(get_current_user)):
    role = current_user.get("role")
    user_id = current_user.get("user_id")
    
    # Check permissions
    if not check_role_permission(role, ["StoreManager", "Management"]):
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="StoreManager, Management or SystemAdmin role required"
        )
    
    # If StoreManager, filter orders by their assigned warehouse
    if role == "StoreManager":
        # Find stores where this user is the contact_person (store manager)
        assigned_stores = db.query(model.Stores).filter(
            model.Stores.contact_person == user_id
        ).all()
        
        if not assigned_stores:
            # Store manager not assigned to any warehouse
            return []
        
        # Get store IDs
        store_ids = [store.store_id for store in assigned_stores]
        
        # Get orders assigned to these warehouses
        orders_ = db.query(model.Orders).filter(
            model.Orders.warehouse_id.in_(store_ids)
        ).all()
    else:
        # Management and SystemAdmin can see all orders
        orders_ = db.query(model.Orders).all()
    
    # Convert enum status to string value
    for order in orders_:
        if isinstance(order.status, model.OrderStatus):
            order.status = order.status.value
    
    return orders_
```

### Logic Flow:

1. **Extract user role and ID** from JWT token
2. **Check permissions** - Must be StoreManager or Management
3. **If StoreManager:**
   - Query `stores` table where `contact_person == user_id`
   - Extract all `store_id` values (their assigned warehouses)
   - Query `orders` table where `warehouse_id IN (assigned_store_ids)`
   - Return only those orders
4. **If Management/SystemAdmin:**
   - Return all orders (no filtering)

---

## Backend Logic - Store Manager Names

### File: `Backend/app/api/stores.py` (Lines 28-56)

```python
# Enrich stores with city names and manager names
result = []
for store in stores:
    store_dict = {
        "store_id": store.store_id,
        "name": store.name,
        "telephone_number": store.telephone_number,
        "address": store.address,
        "contact_person": store.contact_person,  # user_id
        "station_id": store.station_id,
        "city_name": None,
        "manager_name": None  # NEW FIELD
    }
    
    # Get city name through station relationship
    if store.station and store.station.city:
        store_dict["city_name"] = store.station.city.city_name
    
    # Get manager name from users table
    if store.contact_person:
        manager = db.query(model.Users).filter(
            model.Users.user_id == store.contact_person
        ).first()
        if manager:
            store_dict["manager_name"] = manager.user_name  # NEW
    
    result.append(store_dict)

return result
```

### Logic:

1. For each store, check if `contact_person` (user_id) exists
2. If exists, query `users` table to get `user_name`
3. Add `manager_name` to response
4. Frontend displays the manager's actual name instead of user_id

---

## Backend Logic - Get Store Managers

### File: `Backend/app/api/users.py` (Lines 90-96)

```python
@router.get("/store-managers/list", response_model=List[schemas.UserResponse])
async def get_store_managers(db: db_dependency, current_user: dict = Security(get_current_user)):
    """Get all users with StoreManager role for warehouse assignment"""
    store_managers = db.query(model.Users).filter(
        model.Users.role == "StoreManager"
    ).all()
    return store_managers
```

### Purpose:

- Returns all users with `role == "StoreManager"`
- Used to populate the dropdown in Store Management form
- Allows admins to assign any Store Manager to any warehouse

---

## Frontend Implementation

### Store Management Table

**Before:**
```
| Store Name | Contact Person       | Telephone   | Address  | Station | City  |
|------------|---------------------|-------------|----------|---------|-------|
| Warehouse A| uuid-1234-5678      | 0112345678  | Address  | Station | City  |
```

**After:**
```
| Store Name | Store Manager       | Telephone   | Address  | Station | City  |
|------------|---------------------|-------------|----------|---------|-------|
| Warehouse A| [John Doe]          | 0112345678  | Address  | Station | City  |
| Warehouse B| Not assigned        | 0112345678  | Address  | Station | City  |
```

**Visual Enhancements:**
- Assigned managers show with blue badge: `[John Doe]`
- Unassigned shows as: `Not assigned` (italic, gray)

### Store Form Dialog

**Before:**
```
Contact Person: [Text Input Field]
```

**After:**
```
Store Manager: [Dropdown with Store Managers]
  ├── No manager assigned
  ├── John Doe
  ├── Jane Smith
  └── Mike Johnson
```

**Benefits:**
- Can't type invalid user IDs
- Only shows users with StoreManager role
- Clear visual selection
- Option to leave unassigned

## User Workflows

### Workflow 1: Admin Assigns Store Manager to Warehouse

1. Admin navigates to "Store Management" page
2. Clicks "Edit" on a warehouse
3. Opens "Store Manager" dropdown
4. Selects a Store Manager from the list
5. Clicks "Save"
6. Backend updates `contact_person` field in `stores` table
7. Table refreshes, showing manager name with blue badge

### Workflow 2: Store Manager Views Orders

1. Store Manager logs in
2. Navigates to "Orders" page
3. Backend checks their assigned warehouses:
   - Queries `stores` WHERE `contact_person = their_user_id`
   - Gets list of assigned `store_id` values
4. Backend filters orders:
   - Returns orders WHERE `warehouse_id IN (assigned_store_ids)`
5. Store Manager sees only orders from their warehouse(s)

### Workflow 3: Management Views All Orders

1. Management user logs in
2. Navigates to "Orders" page
3. Backend checks role:
   - Role is "Management" → No filtering
4. Returns ALL orders from ALL warehouses
5. Management sees complete order list

## Testing Checklist

### ✅ Backend Tests:

- [x] Store Manager not assigned to warehouse → Returns empty array
- [x] Store Manager assigned to 1 warehouse → Returns only those orders
- [x] Store Manager assigned to multiple warehouses → Returns orders from all assigned
- [x] Management role → Returns all orders
- [x] SystemAdmin role → Returns all orders
- [x] GET /stores/ returns `manager_name` field
- [x] GET /users/store-managers/list returns only StoreManager role users

- [ ] Management login → Verify sees all orders

---

## Database Changes

### No schema changes required!

The `contact_person` field already exists in the `stores` table as a Foreign Key to `users.user_id`. We're just now using it properly for Store Manager assignment.

**Existing Schema:**
```sql
contact_person VARCHAR(36) REFERENCES users(user_id)
```

**Usage:**
- **Before:** Possibly storing text or unused
- **Now:** Stores `user_id` of assigned Store Manager

---

## Security Considerations

### ✅ Implemented:

1. **Authentication Required** - All endpoints check JWT token
2. **Role-Based Filtering** - Store Managers can't see other warehouses' orders
3. **Permission Checks** - Only authorized roles can access orders
4. **Data Isolation** - Store Managers physically can't access other warehouses' data

### ⚠️ Additional Recommendations:

1. **Audit Logging:**
   - Log when Store Managers are assigned/unassigned
   - Track who made the changes
   - Record timestamp of changes

2. **Validation:**
   - Ensure `contact_person` is a valid `user_id`
   - Verify user has `StoreManager` role before assignment
   - Prevent assigning to deleted users

3. **Constraints:**
   - Consider: Should a Store Manager be assigned to only one warehouse?
   - Current: One manager can be assigned to multiple warehouses
   - Add constraint if business requires 1:1 relationship

---

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New Store Manager Assigned

**Initial State:**
```
Store: Colombo Warehouse
Contact Person: NULL
Manager Name: NULL
```

**Action:** Admin assigns John Doe (user_id: USER-123)

**Database Update:**
```sql
UPDATE stores 
SET contact_person = 'USER-123' 
WHERE store_id = 'STORE-ABC';
```

**Result:**
```
Store: Colombo Warehouse
Contact Person: USER-123
Manager Name: "John Doe"
```

**John Doe's Order View:**
- Sees all orders with `warehouse_id = 'STORE-ABC'`
- Previously: Would see no orders (not assigned)

### Scenario 2: Store Manager Reassigned

**Initial:**
- John Doe manages Warehouse A
- Jane Smith manages Warehouse B

**Action:** Assign John Doe to Warehouse B (replacing Jane)

**Database:**
```sql
UPDATE stores 
SET contact_person = 'USER-123' 
WHERE store_id = 'STORE-B';
```

**Result:**
- John Doe now sees orders from Warehouse A AND Warehouse B
- Jane Smith sees no orders (no longer assigned)

### Scenario 3: Unassigning Manager

**Action:** Remove manager from Warehouse A

**Database:**
```sql
UPDATE stores 
SET contact_person = NULL 
WHERE store_id = 'STORE-A';
```

**Result:**
- John Doe no longer sees Warehouse A orders
- Warehouse shows "Not assigned" in frontend

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements:

1. **Multiple Manager Types:**
   - Primary Manager
   - Backup Manager
   - Additional authorized viewers

2. **Manager Dashboard:**
   - Summary of assigned warehouses
   - Quick stats (orders, capacity, etc.)
   - Performance metrics

3. **Assignment History:**
   - Track manager changes over time
   - Audit trail of who managed what when
   - Useful for performance reviews

4. **Notification System:**
   - Notify manager when assigned to warehouse
   - Alert when new orders arrive at their warehouse
   - Email/SMS notifications for important updates

5. **Access Levels:**
   - View-only managers
   - Full-access managers
   - Temporary assignments with expiry dates

6. **Multi-Warehouse View:**
   - Dashboard showing all assigned warehouses
   - Switch between warehouses easily
   - Aggregate statistics across all assignments

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Store Manager sees no orders

**Check:**
1. Is manager assigned to a warehouse?
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM stores WHERE contact_person = 'USER-ID';
   ```
2. Do orders exist for that warehouse?
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM orders WHERE warehouse_id = 'STORE-ID';
   ```
3. Is `warehouse_id` set on orders?
   - Orders must be assigned to warehouses to be visible

**Solution:**
- Assign manager to warehouse in Store Management page
- Ensure orders have `warehouse_id` populated

### Issue: Manager name not showing

**Check:**
1. Does user exist?
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = 'USER-ID';
   ```
2. Is `contact_person` field populated?
   ```sql
   SELECT contact_person FROM stores WHERE store_id = 'STORE-ID';
   ```

**Solution:**
- Verify user exists in `users` table
- Check `contact_person` field has valid `user_id`
- Refresh page to reload data

### Issue: Wrong orders showing

**Check:**
1. Verify user role in JWT token
2. Check assigned warehouses:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM stores WHERE contact_person = 'USER-ID';
   ```
3. Check order warehouse assignments:
   ```sql
   SELECT order_id, warehouse_id FROM orders;
   ```

**Solution:**
- Ensure correct JWT token being used
- Verify warehouse assignments are correct
- Check order-to-warehouse mappings
