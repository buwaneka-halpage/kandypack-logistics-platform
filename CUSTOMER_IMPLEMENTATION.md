## 🔗 Route Structure

### Customer Routes (All Protected)
```typescript
/customer/home          → Customer Home Page ✅
/customer/new-order     → New Order Page 📋
/customer/track-order   → Track Order Page 📋
/customer/order-history → Order History Page 📋
/customer/help-support  → Help & Support Page 📋
```

### Route Configuration
Customer routes use a layout wrapper (`CustomerLayout.tsx`) that includes:
- CustomerHeader (top)
- CustomerSidebar (left)
- Main content area (center)

---

## 🎯 Implementation Approach

### Separation of Concerns
Following best practices from the admin side:

1. **Separate Layout**: Customer pages use their own layout (`CustomerLayout`)
2. **Separate Components**: All customer components in `/components/customer/`
3. **Separate Routes**: Customer routes prefixed with `/customer/`
4. **Consistent Protection**: All routes wrapped with `ProtectedRoute`

### Reused Elements
- **ProtectedRoute**: Same authentication wrapper
- **useAuth hook**: Same authentication logic
- **useSidebar context**: Same sidebar state management
- **UserAvatar**: Same avatar component
- **Shadcn/ui components**: Same UI library (Card, Badge, etc.)

---

## 🎨 Color Scheme

### Customer Theme
- **Primary Navy**: `#282F4E` (sidebar background)
- **Accent Purple**: `#5D5FEF` (active states, branding)
- **Background**: `#F9FAFB` (gray-50)
- **Text**: Dark gray variations

### Comparison with Admin Theme
| Element | Admin | Customer |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Sidebar | Dark Navy | Dark Navy (#282F4E) |
| Accent | Orange-Red | Purple (#5D5FEF) |
| Active State | Orange | Purple |
| Background | Light Gray | Light Gray |

## 🔐 Security

All customer routes are protected using the same `ProtectedRoute` wrapper:
- Checks authentication status
- Redirects to login if not authenticated
- Shows loading state during auth check
- Maintains session with localStorage

---

## 📖 How to Access

### Development
1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:5173/customer/home`
3. Ensure you're logged in (authentication required)

### Navigation
- Use the sidebar to navigate between customer pages
- Click on any menu item to switch pages
- All navigation is instant (React Router)

---

## 🎨 Design Consistency

The customer interface maintains consistency with the admin side while having its own identity:

### Shared Elements
- Same header height and structure
- Same authentication system
- Same loading states
- Same error handling
- Same responsive breakpoints

### Unique Elements
- Purple accent color (vs orange for admin)
- Simplified navigation (5 items vs 9)
- Customer-focused terminology
- Simpler data displays
- User-friendly language

---

## 📊 Mock Data

Currently using sample data for demonstration:

### Active Orders
- 2 orders with full details

### Delivered Orders
- 7 total orders (3 shown)
- Sample order IDs
