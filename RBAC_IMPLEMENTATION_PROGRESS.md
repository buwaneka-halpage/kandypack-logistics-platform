# RBAC Implementation Progress Summary

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Project:** KandyPack Logistics Platform  
**Focus:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Frontend Implementation

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. **Username Authentication Update**
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Changes Made:**
- Updated `User` interface in `useAuth.tsx` to use `username` instead of `email`
- Modified login functions to accept `username` parameter
- Updated both `login.tsx` and `customer-login.tsx` forms:
  - Changed labels from "Email" to "Username"
  - Changed input types from `email` to `text`
  - Updated placeholders (e.g., `admin_user` instead of `username@gmail.com`)
  - Updated default values for testing

**Why:** Backend uses random usernames in the database, not email addresses.

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/UI/app/hooks/useAuth.tsx`
- `frontend/UI/app/routes/login.tsx`
- `frontend/UI/app/routes/customer-login.tsx`

   - Same layout as Management with admin-specific widgets

3. **Store Manager Dashboard**
   - Warehouse-specific view
   - Shows assigned warehouse name
   - Warning if no warehouse assigned
   - Stats: Warehouse Orders, Pending Shipments, Active Routes, Available Drivers
   - Charts filtered to warehouse data

4. **Warehouse Staff Dashboard**
   - Limited to inventory operations
   - Shows assigned warehouse
   - Stats: Orders to Process, Incoming Shipments, Ready for Dispatch
   - Delivery progress widget

5. **Driver Dashboard**

**Status:** 🔄 Not Started

**Plan:**
- Create `AuditLog.tsx` component

  - Action type (CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE, ASSIGN)
  - Date range
  - Resource (Orders, Warehouses, Users)
  
**Features:**
- Show who assigned which order to which warehouse
- Track login/logout events

- Export to CSV

**Access Control:**
- Management and SystemAdmin only
- Requires `audit:read` permission

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture Summary

### Authentication Flow:
```
User Login (username + password)
    ↓
Backend validates & returns JWT
    ↓
Frontend extracts: user_id, role, warehouse_id, warehouse_name
    ↓
Store in localStorage (token + user object)
    ↓
All API calls include: Authorization: Bearer <token>
    ↓
Backend validates JWT & authorizes based on role + warehouse
```

### Permission Scopes:
1. **`all` scope** - Management, SystemAdmin (all warehouses)
2. **`warehouse` scope** - StoreManager, WarehouseStaff, DriverAssistant (assigned warehouse only)
3. **`own` scope** - Customer, Driver (own resources only)

### Warehouse-Scoped Access:
- User object includes: `warehouseId`, `warehouseName`
- API calls filter by `warehouse_id` parameter
- Frontend checks `hasUserPermissionWithScope(resource, action, resourceWarehouseId)`
- Backend enforces warehouse isolation at API level

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Current Implementation:
✅ JWT-based authentication  
✅ Role-based route protection  
✅ Permission-based access control

### Required (Backend):
⚠️ Backend warehouse validation  
⚠️ Cross-warehouse access prevention  
⚠️ Audit logging for warehouse assignments  
⚠️ Rate limiting on assignment endpoints  
⚠️ Row-level security in database
