## Breaking Changes

### Authentication System
- 🔄 **Current**: LocalStorage-based (development only)

## Known Issues

2. **Mock Data**: All data is currently hardcoded
3. **LocalStorage Auth**: Not suitable for production
4. **No Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration needed
5. **Limited Error Handling**: Need more comprehensive error messages
